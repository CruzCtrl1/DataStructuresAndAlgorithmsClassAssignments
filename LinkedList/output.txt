Testing the Link-Based List:
isEmpty: returns 1; should be 1 (true)
Inserted one at position 1
Inserted two at position 2
Inserted three at position 3
Inserted four at position 4
Inserted five at position 5
Inserted six at position 6
The list contains 
one two three four five six 

isEmpty: returns 0; should be 0 (false)
getLength returns : 6; should be 6
The entry at position 4 is four; should be four
After replacing the entry at position 3 with XXX: The list contains 
one two XXX four five six 

Testing the reverse function:
First making a list.
Inserted A at position 1
Inserted B at position 2
Inserted C at position 3
Inserted D at position 4
Inserted E at position 5
The list contains 
A B C D E 

Using the reverse function:
The list contains
